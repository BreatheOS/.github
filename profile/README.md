Air pollution has become an emergency in our country, India.  Every year, we see people in Delhi and other major cities struggling to breathe. Those who can afford it leave the city for a few months; those who cannot are forced to live with toxic air every single day.  

Whenever I see people abroad posting pictures of clear skies and clean air, I feel disheartened.  
In India, clean air is still treated as a *luxury* — when in fact, it’s a **basic necessity** and a **shared right**, not a privilege.  

While this README isn’t meant to be a rant, I want to take a moment to share the *why* behind this project.

### 💨 What is BreatheOS?  

**BreatheOS** stands for **Breathe Operating System** (or, if you like, **Breathe Open Source**).  

I think of it as an *operating system for cleaner air* — an open, sustainable foundation designed to enable people to breathe better. 🌬️  

It’s not just software. It’s a step toward a future where technology, awareness, and collective action converge to restore one of humanity’s most fundamental needs — **the right to clean air**. 🌏

### 🎯 Vision  

The long-term goal of BreatheOS is simple yet ambitious:  
> To solve air pollution in India — through awareness, measurement, collaboration, and innovation. ✨  

I am not an expert in this domain, hence starting with the basic steps and aim is to share everything I learn so that it can at least be a stepping stone for someone like me who also feels the same way that I do.  

This starts with:  
- 📚 **Learning** about air pollution and its causes  
- 📊 **Measuring** pollution levels accurately and openly  
- 🔬 **Researching** ways to contain and reduce pollution at scale  
- 📢 **Building awareness** around actionable solutions that anyone can participate in  
- 🏗️ **Implementation** — the final and most important goal: to build at scale to solve the problem  

Every line of code, every dataset, and every small project within this organization aims to move us closer to that goal. 💚
